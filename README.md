Object Oriented Design Patterns

<h3>SOLID Principles.</h3>

<p>
    Dependency Inversion is one of the last principles we are going to look at. The principle states that:

    High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

    Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
